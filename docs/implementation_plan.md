---

## Phase 1: Knowledge Base Construction
**Duration**: 3-4 hours  
**Goal**: Extract, process, and structure content into RAG-ready knowledge base

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Content Extraction (Hybrid Approach)
- [ ] **Implement PyMuPDF extraction**:
```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
def extract_simple_text(pdf_path, page_range):
    # Extract text from simple pages
    pass
```

- [ ] **Implement pdfplumber for tables**:
```python
import pdfplumber
def extract_table_data(pdf_path, page_numbers):
    # Extract structured table data
    pass
```

- [ ] **Manual extraction for complex pages**:
  - Identify 3-5 most critical complex pages
  - Manually transcribe key intervention details
  - Focus on flowcharts and multi-column layouts

#### 1.2 Content Processing & Standardization
- [ ] **Create intervention extraction function**:
```python
def extract_interventions(raw_text, source_doc):
    """Extract structured intervention data"""
    interventions = []
    # Parse for intervention name, description, steps, target indicators
    return interventions
```

- [ ] **Process each document**:
  - FOT Toolkit Tool Set C → Core intervention framework
  - Check & Connect → Mentoring strategies
  - UChicago Research → Rationale and evidence base
  - REL Resources → Attendance strategies
  - Success for All → Comprehensive approaches
  - NCSSLE Guide → Behavioral interventions

#### 1.3 Knowledge Base Structuring
- [ ] **Create standardized intervention format**:
```python
intervention_schema = {
    "id": str,
    "name": str,
    "description": str,
    "implementation_steps": List[str],
    "target_indicators": List[str],  # credits, attendance, behavior
    "evidence_level": str,
    "source_document": str,
    "educator_guidance": str
}
```

- [ ] **Implement semantic chunking**:
  - Chunk by intervention type (300-500 words)
  - Add 50-word overlap between chunks
  - Create metadata tags for each chunk

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All documents successfully processed using appropriate extraction method
- ✅ 20+ distinct interventions identified and structured
- ✅ Standardized data format with consistent metadata
- ✅ Quality validation: random sample review shows accurate extraction

---

## Phase 2: RAG Pipeline Implementation
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Goal**: Build and test the core RAG functionality

### Tasks

#### 2.1 Vector Embedding Setup
- [ ] **Initialize embedding model**:
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
```

- [ ] **Create embeddings for knowledge base**:
```python
def create_embeddings(intervention_chunks):
    embeddings = model.encode(intervention_chunks)
    return embeddings
```

- [ ] **Set up FAISS vector database**:
```python
import faiss
def create_vector_db(embeddings):
    dimension = embeddings.shape[1]
    index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(dimension)  # Inner product for similarity
    index.add(embeddings)
    return index
```

#### 2.2 Retrieval System
- [ ] **Implement semantic search**:
```python
def search_interventions(query, index, intervention_data, k=3):
    query_embedding = model.encode([query])
    scores, indices = index.search(query_embedding, k)
    return [(intervention_data[i], scores[0][idx]) for idx, i in enumerate(indices[0])]
```

- [ ] **Test retrieval with sample queries**:
  - "Student failing core classes and missing school"
  - "Attendance problems and behavioral issues"
  - "Low credits earned, needs academic support"

#### 2.3 Response Generation
- [ ] **Create educator-friendly formatter**:
```python
def format_recommendations(retrieved_interventions, student_profile):
    formatted_response = []
    for intervention, score in retrieved_interventions:
        recommendation = {
            "intervention_name": intervention["name"],
            "rationale": f"Recommended because: {explain_match(intervention, student_profile)}",
            "implementation_steps": intervention["implementation_steps"],
            "source": intervention["source_document"],
            "confidence_score": score
        }
        formatted_response.append(recommendation)
    return formatted_response
```

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Vector database successfully created with all intervention embeddings
- ✅ Semantic search returns relevant results for test queries
- ✅ Response format is educator-friendly with clear implementation guidance
- ✅ Source citations are properly maintained throughout pipeline

## Phase 3: System Integration & Testing
**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Goal**: End-to-end testing with provided student profile

### Tasks

#### 3.1 End-to-End Pipeline Integration
- [ ] **Create main recommendation function**:
```python
def get_fot_recommendations(student_profile_narrative):
    # 1. Process student narrative
    # 2. Perform semantic search  
    # 3. Retrieve top 3 interventions
    # 4. Format for educators
    # 5. Return structured recommendations
    pass
```

#### 3.2 Testing with Sample Student Profile
- [ ] **Test with provided profile**:
```python
sample_student = """This student is struggling to keep up with coursework, 
having failed one core class and earning only 2.5 credits out of 4 credits 
expected for the semester. Attendance is becoming a concern at 88% for an 
average annual target of 90%, and they have had one behavioral incident. 
The student needs targeted academic and attendance support to get back on 
track for graduation."""

recommendations = get_fot_recommendations(sample_student)
```

#### 3.3 Quality Validation & Refinement
- [ ] **Evaluate recommendation quality**:
  - Do recommendations address student's specific risk factors?
  - Are implementation steps clear and actionable?
  - Are source citations accurate and helpful?

- [ ] **Refine retrieval if needed**:
  - Adjust embedding model parameters
  - Modify chunking strategy if results are poor
  - Fine-tune response formatting

### Success Criteria
- ✅ End-to-end pipeline processes student profile successfully
- ✅ Returns exactly 3 relevant intervention recommendations
- ✅ Each recommendation includes implementation steps and source citation
- ✅ Recommendations directly address student's risk factors (credits, attendance, behavior)

- [ ] **Create FastAPI application**:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI(title="FOT Intervention Recommender")

@app.post("/recommend")
async def get_recommendations(student_narrative: str):
    return get_fot_recommendations(student_narrative)
```

- [ ] **Containerize with Docker**
- [ ] **Create deployment documentation**

### Option B: Persona-Based Recommendations (Bonus 2)
- [ ] **Implement persona-specific prompts**:
```python
def generate_persona_recommendations(interventions, persona):
    # Teacher: Classroom-focused, actionable steps
    # Parent: Supportive language, home-based strategies  
    # Principal: Resource requirements, systemic approach
    pass
```

### Success Criteria (if attempted)
- ✅ Bonus feature fully functional and demonstrated
- ✅ Added value is clear and well-articulated
- ✅ Implementation quality matches core system standards

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Complex PDF extraction fails**: Fall back to manual extraction for critical pages
- **Poor embedding quality**: Test alternative models (e.g., `all-mpnet-base-v2`)
- **Retrieval returns irrelevant results**: Adjust chunking strategy or add filtering

### Time Management Risks  
- **Document processing takes too long**: Prioritize FOT Toolkit + 2 highest-quality external sources
- **Perfectionism trap**: Focus on working MVP first, refinements second
- **Scope creep**: Stick to core deliverables, save enhancements for bonus phase

### Quality Risks
- **Recommendations not educator-friendly**: Test format with simple language review
- **Source citations missing**: Implement citation tracking from extraction phase
- **System doesn't handle edge cases**: Build in error handling and fallback responses
