# Final Research Brief: Knowledge Base for the FOT Intervention Recommender

## 1. Project Context

The goal is to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that recommends evidence-based interventions for at-risk 9th-grade students. This research brief outlines the process for identifying at least five high-quality sources that detail specific, actionable intervention strategies. These sources will form the core knowledge base, complementing the strategic framework provided in the FOT Toolkit Tool Set C.

## 2. Guiding Philosophy: From "Map" to "Tour Guide"

Our knowledge base strategy is guided by a clear distinction:

**The FOT Toolkit is the "Map"**: It provides the high-level framework for planning, tracking, and evaluating interventions.

**Our Curated Sources are the "Tour Guides"**: They must provide the detailed, step-by-step "playbooks" that describe exactly how to implement a specific intervention.

## 3. Research Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Identify 5+ authoritative documents that provide specific, evidence-based, and actionable intervention strategies for 9th-grade students.

**Focus Areas**: The search will prioritize interventions that directly address the core Freshman On-Track indicators. While these often exist within a larger Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) framework, our focus is on the specific actions, not the system's architecture.

- **Academic Recovery Interventions**: (e.g., Credit recovery, targeted tutoring)
- **Attendance Improvement Strategies**: (e.g., Chronic absenteeism programs, mentoring)
- **Behavioral & Social-Emotional Supports**: (e.g., Tier 2 behavioral interventions, SEL programs)

## 4. Search Strategy

**Primary Keywords**: "freshman on-track interventions", "9th grade student support", "high school transition interventions", "early warning systems high school", "tier 2 interventions secondary".

**Specific Keywords**: "credit recovery programs", "chronic absenteeism interventions", "freshman mentoring programs", "high-dosage tutoring", "restorative practices high school".

**Authoritative Sources**:
- **Research Institutions**: What Works Clearinghouse (WWC), University of Chicago Consortium on School Research, Regional Educational Labs (RELs), Institute of Education Sciences (IES)
- **Educational Organizations**: National High School Center, RTI Action Network, Attendance Works, ASCD
- **Databases**: ERIC, peer-reviewed educational journals

## 5. Quality Criteria Checklist for Source Selection

Each selected source must meet the following criteria:

- [✔] **Specificity**: Contains detailed, step-by-step procedures, not just high-level theory
- [✔] **Evidence-Based**: Includes outcome data, research validation, or is cited by a reputable clearinghouse
- [✔] **Implementation-Ready**: Provides practical guidance, templates, or examples for educators
- [✔] **Freshman-Focused**: Specifically addresses the needs of 9th-grade or transitioning high school students
- [✔] **Complementary**: Adds new, actionable content not already covered in the FOT Toolkit's framework

## 6. Deliverable for Each Curated Source

For each of the five (or more) documents selected, a standardized summary will be created for inclusion in the "Deliverable 1: Project Plan." This summary is crucial and must contain:

- **Citation**: Full title, author/organization, and a direct URL
- **Intervention Category**: The primary domain it addresses (Academic, Attendance, or Behavior)
- **Core Strategy**: A one-sentence summary of the intervention's central concept
- **Actionable Components**: 3-4 bullet points detailing the specific, repeatable steps an educator would take to implement the intervention

## 7. Success Metrics for Research Phase

This research phase will be considered complete when the curated knowledge base enables the future RAG system to:

- Recommend a specific academic intervention for a student with course failures
- Suggest a clear attendance improvement strategy for a student with <90% attendance
- Provide a concrete behavioral support option for a student with discipline flags
- Present an evidence-based rationale for each recommendation
