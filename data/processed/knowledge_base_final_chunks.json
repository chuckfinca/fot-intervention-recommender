        "content_for_embedding": "Title: Intervention: Mentoring. Content: Mentoring programs are developed by schools to provide a range of supports to students and are primarily meant to establish an ongoing positive relationship between a student and a caring adult. Mentors can be individuals working in or with connections to the school, or they can be drawn from the community. Mentors may be older students within the school. Connecting students with mentors has been shown to reduce student chronic absenteeism. Mentoring programs vary in structure and can include individuals both within the school or from the community. One example of a mentoring program that uses mentors from within the school building is LISTEN (Linking Individual Students to Educational Needs). This program worked to establish a positive relationship between students displaying symptoms of risk and caring adults, such as school administrators, teachers, custodians, and others in the same school as the students. The mentoring relationship focused on several areas, including study habits, communication skills, and interpersonal relationships. An example of a mentoring program that included individuals from inside and outside of the school is New York City\u2019s Success Mentors Corps. This program included three types of mentors: adults from outside organizations such as AmeriCorps, trained school staff, and peer mentors, who are high school juniors who mentor their grade 9 peers.\n\nA study examining the impact of Success Mentors on the attendance of approximately 10,000 students with histories of chronic absenteeism found that these students, on average, gained almost two additional weeks of schooling in the year(s) they had a mentor. The study found that in-school staff (for example, teachers, coaches, noncertified staff) and external community partners (for example, national service corps members, social work students, retired professionals) had similar effects on student attendance. May et al. (2021) examined outcomes of secondary students who received mentorship from adult volunteers providing emotional support, behavioral support, and academic tutoring help two or more days per week at the school site. The authors found positive impacts on attendance and student achievement. Greater gains were shown for students who had a mentor for both middle and high school instead of one or the other. Other research found that mentors reduced chronic absenteeism in students from one year to the next and that having activities focused on attendance reduced the percentage of students who missed at least 20 days of school in a year. Other benefits of mentoring programs include a positive association with grade point average and discipline referrals.",

Content: Check & Connect is an intervention that uses a framework of mentoring and case management aimed toward reducing school dropout. The \u201cCheck\u201d component is includes frequent monitoring of student performance and progress. The \u201cConnect\u201d component involves program staff giving individualized attention to students while coordinating with other school staff, family members, and community organizations as relevant. Check & Connect aligns with the mentoring section of this handout, as this program matches an adult to check in with a student regularly over time.\n\nHowever, it includes specific elements that are not always included in a typical mentoring program, including a core focus on the adult and student checking in on and documenting attendance, behaviors, and academic performance. Check & Connect adults serve as check-in partner and case manager, typically with less one-on-one time for students than some mentoring programs. Check & Connect can be used with any K\u201312 student and has been implemented with students in all demographic groups with an emphasis on students who showed signs of disengagement (for example, lowered attendance and academic achievement). Check & Connect includes practices geared toward improving four \u201csalient and pliable student-level factors\u201d linked to dropout: attendance, academic achievement, engagement, and behavior.\n\nMaynard et al. (2013) evaluated the impact of Check & Connect in a rigorous randomized controlled trial of middle and high school students who already received Communities in Schools (CIS) services. There were positive differences in attendance, academic performance, and behavior for CIS students who also received Check & Connect compared with students who received CIS services only. Two studies examined the effects of Check & Connect on secondary students with disabilities. The studies found that the program increases the likelihood that students will both stay in and progress in school.",

Content: Behavioral interventions are a type of psychosocial intervention, a category that includes cognitive behavioral therapy, social skills training, and other supports to reduce emotional distress, improve prosocial behaviors, and subsequently increase attendance. Nudge theory consists of unobtrusive interventions that are intended to promote a desired behavior.\n\nNudging interventions in educational settings often entail some sort of communication (for example, text, postcard) that reminds the recipient of an action that should be taken or provides information that may spur specific behavior. Nudging and other brief behavioral interventions have included students from all grade levels, geographical contexts, and demographic groups. A research review by Maynard et al. (2015) found high-quality studies of psychosocial interventions applied in both elementary and secondary students. Nudging can include sending families a periodic postcard with student attendance records and/or encouragement to strive for consistent attendance to reduce absenteeism, or sending weekly updates on missed assignments or absences.\n\nBehavioral interventions: Brief and simple interventions aimed at affecting student mindset and self-image are intended to increase school performance. Several rigorous studies showed that middle school students of color who participated in a self-affirming classroom writing exercise had improved academic and attendance outcomes that persisted over years. Cognitive behavioral therapy was found to have significant positive effects on attendance among K\u201312 students in multiple countries.\nNudging: Low-cost behavioral interventions such as nudges and other simple psychosocial interventions have been found to be effective in improving student attendance. Rogers et al. (2017) conducted a randomized controlled trial and found that a single postcard that encouraged guardians to improve their student\u2019s attendance reduced absences by roughly 2.4 percent. This positive effect was found for elementary and secondary students. Heppen et al. (2020) tested several text messaging strategies with families of 26,000 elementary students, showing that all strategies and message content were effective at reducing the chronic absence rate. For students who were chronically absent in the fall, personal texts directly from the teacher were associated with bigger improvements than automated text messages. Intensified messaging that involved school staff directly texting parents reduced chronic absence rates in the spring more than the other more automated intensified approach, for students with a prior history of high absences.",
