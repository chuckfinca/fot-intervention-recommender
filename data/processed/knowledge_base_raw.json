A tracking tool is more effective when it is in a teacher-friendly format that can be disaggregated to pull data for specific subgroups. For example, if your team is using tutoring as an intervention, and the targeted student group requires tutoring in more than one core class, your tracking tool should be able to disaggregate data to ascertain intervention impact by course. Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets can support the tracking of interventions by disaggregating data and creating graphs."

Students identified through indicators experienced decreased suspensions, increased earned high school credits, and increased high school grade point average; however, these differences did not meet the threshold for statistical significance. In a study of Chicago Public Schools that used the Freshman OnTrack Indicator, which combines course failures and credit accumulation into a single EWI, students who were found to be on track at the end of ninth grade were more likely to graduate on time and be prepared for postsecondary education. An EWI such as the Freshman OnTrack Indicator is part of a broader EWS process and can be used to identify which students need additional attention."

Mentors can be individuals working in or with connections to the school, or they can be drawn from the community. Mentors may be older students within the school. Connecting students with mentors has been shown to reduce student chronic absenteeism. Mentoring programs vary in structure and can include individuals both within the school or from the community. One example of a mentoring program that uses mentors from within the school building is LISTEN (Linking Individual Students to Educational Needs). This program worked to establish a positive relationship between students displaying symptoms of risk and caring adults, such as school administrators, teachers, custodians, and others in the same school as the students. The mentoring relationship focused on several areas, including study habits, communication skills, and interpersonal relationships. An example of a mentoring program that included individuals from inside and outside of the school is New York City’s Success Mentors Corps. This program included three types of mentors: adults from outside organizations such as AmeriCorps, trained school staff, and peer mentors, who are high school juniors who mentor their grade 9 peers."

The study found that in-school staff (for example, teachers, coaches, noncertified staff) and external community partners (for example, national service corps members, social work students, retired professionals) had similar effects on student attendance. May et al. (2021) examined outcomes of secondary students who received mentorship from adult volunteers providing emotional support, behavioral support, and academic tutoring help two or more days per week at the school site. The authors found positive impacts on attendance and student achievement. Greater gains were shown for students who had a mentor for both middle and high school instead of one or the other. Other research found that mentors reduced chronic absenteeism in students from one year to the next and that having activities focused on attendance reduced the percentage of students who missed at least 20 days of school in a year. Other benefits of mentoring programs include a positive association with grade point average and discipline referrals."

Check & Connect can be used with any K–12 student and has been implemented with students in all demographic groups with an emphasis on students who showed signs of disengagement (for example, lowered attendance and academic achievement).

        "content": "Behavioral interventions: Brief and simple interventions aimed at affecting student mindset and self-image are intended to increase school performance. Several rigorous studies showed that middle school students of color who participated in a self-affirming classroom writing exercise had improved academic and attendance outcomes that persisted over years. Cognitive behavioral therapy was found to have significant positive effects on attendance among K–12 students in multiple countries.\nNudging: Low-cost behavioral interventions such as nudges and other simple psychosocial interventions have been found to be effective in improving student attendance. Rogers et al. (2017) conducted a randomized controlled trial and found that a single postcard that encouraged guardians to improve their student’s attendance reduced absences by roughly 2.4 percent. This positive effect was found for elementary and secondary students. Heppen et al. (2020) tested several text messaging strategies with families of 26,000 elementary students, showing that all strategies and message content were effective at reducing the chronic absence rate. For students who were chronically absent in the fall, personal texts directly from the teacher were associated with bigger improvements than automated text messages. Intensified messaging that involved school staff directly texting parents reduced chronic absence rates in the spring more than the other more automated intensified approach, for students with a prior history of high absences."

The 'Check' component is designed to continually monitor student performance and progress. The 'Connect' component involves program staff giving individualized attention to students in partnership with other school staff, family members, and community service organizations. Students enrolled in Check & Connect are assigned a 'monitor' who regularly reviews information on attendance, behavior, or academic problems and intervenes when problems are identified. The monitor also advocates for students, coordinates services, provides ongoing feedback and encouragement, and emphasizes the importance of staying in school."
